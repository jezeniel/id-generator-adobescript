	PhotoFormat -> Art Layer this will be a reference for your ID photo's style and position
	IDName  -> Text Layer will get content in names.txt
	IDNum   -> Text Layer will get content in idnums.txt
	Email   -> Text Layer will get content in emails.txt
	Contact -> Text Layer will get content in contacts.txt

note: 
	-the text files will must be named exactly as listed above.
	 and name your psd file as ID.psd
